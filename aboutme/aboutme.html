                        employees; 3) create training materials and keeping them up-to-date; 4) design and devolope training programms; 5)

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I am always eager to learn something new and develop myself. That is one of the reasons why I decided to switch to IT industry.
                        I am responsible and self-disciplined. Also, one of my best qualities, I'm never afraid of putting an extra effort to achieve results.
                        On top of that I'm fluent in 3 most popular languages in Latvia: Latvian, Russian and English.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My short-term goal is to become a professional WEB developer and get experience and knoledge of the IT world. Speaking about long-term goals,
                        I'd really want to either become a part of team that devolps software, apps, videogames or establish my own IT company.
